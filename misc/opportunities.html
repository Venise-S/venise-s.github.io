		<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

		<p>One of the greatest advancements in the creation of artificial organs are the advancements of 3D printing
			that allows for the automatic assembly of materials.
			It is because of how artificial organs are reliant on technology improving, the functionality will improve
			over time and will make such organs safer for the patient in the future.</p>

		<img src="/images/researcher.png" alt="biomedical researcher">
		
		<p>The advancement of artificial organs will be able to save more lives, as a result of how the creation of
			organs without the need for a donor will reduce the demand and waitlist for organ transplants.
			Additionally, artificial organs can be even safer than organ transplants, because of how patients are less
			likely to experience organ rejection.</p>
