		<p>While Artificial organs are able to save and improve countless lives, they are still some potential issues
			that may arise.</p>
		<p>They are:</p> 
		<ol>
			<li>surface or gas effects on solid and fluid constituents of blood </li>
			<li>immunologic problems</li> 
			<li>hydrodynamic effects </li>
			<li>biochemical effects</li>
			<li>potential carcinogens </li>
			<li>potential teratogens </li>
			<li>physical incompatibilities which include heat, electricity, and mechanical support problems</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Early-phase clinical trials are known to be risky and ethically challenging especially on first-in-human.</p>

		<p>Over the course of 5 years, transplant surgeries of vital organs, such as the heart and lungs, have not had
			promising success rates.
			According to Organ Donor New Zealand, The least successful surgery were lung transplants, at a 60% success
			rate, followed by the heart, at 78%.</p>
