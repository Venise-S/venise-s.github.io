		<h1>Social Impacts of Artificial Organs</h1>

		<h4>What are Artificial Organs?</h4>

		<p>Artificial organs are defined as an engineered device that can be implanted or integrated into a human body,
			used
			to replace a natural organ and duplicate or augment a specific function so the patient may return to a
			normal
			life as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>There is a large range of organs that have been created, including hearts, kidneys and even external organs
			such
			as ears and eyes. They can be divided into three main classes: mechanical, bioartificial, or biomechanical.
			This
			is based on what types of materials are used to create the organ, which can be either artificial polymers or
			organic cells.</p>
		<p>We had chosen this topic because we had found it interesting that the advancement of technology has allowed
			for
			the development of better artificial organs, but there are also several risks and potential negative
			implications on patients.</p>
